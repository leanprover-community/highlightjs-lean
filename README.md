# highlightjs-lean

A [highlightjs](https://highlightjs.org/) language grammar for the
[Lean](https://leanprover.github.io) theorem proving language.

## Usage

(Usage instructions adapted from the [highlightjs-robots-txt README.md](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlightjs-robots-txt/blob/master/README.md).)

Simply include the Highlight.js library in your webpage or Node app, then load this module.

This adds a `sorry` style on top of the standard highlightjs styles for highlighting `sorry` and `admit`.
You can set the color of this by adding the following CSS style:
```html
<style>
.hljs-sorry {
  color: red;
}
</style>
```

### Static website or simple usage

Simply load the module after loading Highlight.js. You'll use the minified version found in the `dist` directory. This module is just a CDN build of the language, so it will register itself as the Javascript is loaded.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/highlight.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8"
  src="/path/to/highlightjs-lean/dist/lean.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
</script>
```

### Using directly from the UNPKG CDN

```html
<script type="text/javascript"
  src="https://unpkg.com/highlightjs-lean/dist/lean.min.js"></script>
```

### With Node or another build system

If you're using Node / Webpack / Rollup / Browserify, etc, simply require the language module, then register it with Highlight.js.

```javascript
var hljs = require('highlightjs');
var leanHljs = require('highlightjs-lean');

hljs.registerLanguage("lean", leanHljs);
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
```
